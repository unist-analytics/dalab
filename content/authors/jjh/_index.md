Hello, my name is Jae Hun Cho. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Engineering from Gyeongsang National University, and I am currently attending in AI graduate school at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology(UNIST). When I was in college, I had a project to find a disease called epiretinal membrane using ophthalmic OCT images and a project to create an image using ophthalmic retinal images using generation models. I'm interested in medical image analysis, Machine learning and Deep learning, generative model, Computer Vision, and Object Detection.
