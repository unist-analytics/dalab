I have been working for LG Electronics, since 2012. 
I've mainly conducted research into the control of Home appliance system based on machine learning with experimental data (R&D Engineer)
and customer behavior for using Home appliance(Data analyst).
I'm interested in Data Mining and Statistical Analysis and Business Intelligence and Strategy based on data.
